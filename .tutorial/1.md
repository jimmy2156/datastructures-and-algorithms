**Estimated Time**: 6 mins

If you're a beginner or are somewhat new to coding, then this is the perfect tutorial for you. You'll be coding in the `index.js` file which is currently open in your code editor. It's the only file you'll need to be in for this section of the course. 

If you ever want to navigate to the file section you can do so by  clicking the `folded paper icon` on the left hand side of your screen.
